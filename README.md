# HCL SoFy Docs
This repository contains the source and configuration files for [sofydocs.com](https://sofydocs.com) which will become the documentation hub for [HCL SoFy](https://hclsofy.com), the HCL Software Cloud Native portal.

## Contributing
Issue reports and pull requests will be accepted once we have an first version of the site ready.

## Development
 
[sofydocs.com](https://sofydocs.com) runs a GitHub Pages application but can be developed and run locally as well
The site is based primarly on the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [Just the Docs](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs) Jekyll theme. 

_Steps to setup a local development environment will be coming soon_
