# **Default Login Credentials**

The products or services which are included in a solution may have default login credentials. You can find these default credentials through the following:

## **User Documentation in the SoFy Catalog**
In the SoFy Catalog, click on a service or product's card to access default credentials in the user documentation.

## **Solution Console**
The Solution Console is accessible once your solution has been deployed. The default login for the Solution Console is:
* User: sol-admin
* Password: pass

Once you are logged in, you can obtain the default logins for your service or product in the Solution Console. To view the default logins, click on **General Information** on your service or product's card on the Dashboard.

These are the default credentials and may not work if they have already been reset/changed. If you are unable to login, please contact SoFy Support.
