# **Solution Overview**

A SoFy Solution is a Kubernetes application, described by a Helm chart that is generated by SoFy.
A solution includes:
* One or more services or products selected from the SoFy Catalog, which provide the desired application capabilities
* Routing and monitoring services
* Optional platform services, known as SoFy Common Services, that provide a secure and managed environment; opt in or out when you create a new SoFy Solution

All services are managed through their applicable Helm charts. When a solution is installed into Kubernetes, the services run in a private network, communicating with each other using internal IP addresses that are not accessible by services outside the Solutionâ€™s network. All access from outside the Solution, such as from your browser or local application, is made through the single external IP address for the solution. This external IP address connects to the routing component, or ingress controller. SoFy uses [Ambassador](https://www.getambassador.io/) as the ingress controller for each solution. It provides a useful control point for all traffic in and out of the Solution network, for example to apply access control.
